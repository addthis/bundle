# bundle

## packets, packets, everywhere

`bundle` is a java library for creating and accessing internal
representations of individual packets or bundles of data.  The
canonical use is for log lines.

Elements are represented as using primitives and basic structures
(arrays, maps).  Bundle's *raison d'Ãªtre* is to allow fast (no hash)
access to basic but arbitrary structured data like (no ahead of time
POJOs).  This depends on the format for a stream of bundles not
changing too often (again, like log lines).

Bundles can be serialized for exchange through an analytic pipeline.
They can also serve as the native or original log format, but there is
no schema support to assist with this.  They cannot do POJO
data-binding and are not intended as a general purpose java
serialization library.


## Building

`mvn test`

## Use

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.addthis</groupId>
  <artifactId>bundle</artifactId>
  <version>latest-and-greatest</version>
</dependency>
```

You can either install locally, or releases will eventually make their
way to maven central.
